I became fascinated by technology at a young age. The intrigue started with computer games;
it blew me away that I could control characters on a screen, and they moved so seamlessly.
Also, the ability to chat with friends, play games online, and connect with virtually anyone on the planet was mind-boggling to me.
All of those typical things we take for granted really sparked my interest, and I had to know how it all worked.

<p>I knew I wanted to explore my career with computers after learning the inner workings of an everyday router.
Connecting my xbox to the internet seems like such a simple task now, but when I was a kid, it was my number one goal in life.
I wanted to understand how it worked and share that knowledge with my friends.
Fast forward (however many years) later, and I now know how to write actual computer code.

 I enjoy technology and being able to write programs to improve my everyday life makes me enjoy it so much more. I aspire to one day create
software that better improves cyber technologies in a revolutionary way.
